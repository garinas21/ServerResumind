You are an expert data extraction and translation system for job postings. Your task is to analyze the following raw text from a job posting and extract the key information into a structured JSON format.

Your response MUST be a valid JSON object. Do not include any text, markdown, or explanations outside of the JSON structure.

***IMPORTANT RULE: All string values in the final JSON object must be in English. If the source text for a field is in another language, you must translate it to professional English before including it in the response.***

The JSON object must have the following structure:

{
  "title": "<The job title>",
  "company": "<The company name>",
  "location": "<The primary location of the job>",
  "employmentType": "<The type of employment>",
  "experienceLevel": "<The required years of experience>",
  "summary": "<A one-sentence summary of the job's core purpose>",
  "keySkills": [
    "<An array of strings listing the most important technical skills and tools>"
  ],
  "responsibilities": [
    "<An array of strings, where each string is a bullet point from the 'Responsibilities' section>"
  ],
  "requirements": [
    "<An array of strings, where each string is a bullet point from the 'Requirements' or 'Qualifications' section>"
